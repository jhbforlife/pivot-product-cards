# pivot product cards
hello! this is my first project for the pre-work section of the pivot software development program, and my first HTML/CSS project at that!

with that said, I am overall happy with how it has turned out, though a couple of things are still bothering me that I may try to fix in the future:
- the MacBook image doesn't appear as large as the others
    - I think the best way to fix this would be to add blank space to the other two to shrink them down to about the same size
- when making the window smaller, the cards are no longer the same size or center aligned as you approach the 800px breakpoint
- I think an animation to the smaller UI layout would be nice instead of just the abrupt change
- when in the smaller UI design, when you get the window really small, the buttons kind of collaspe in on themselves

there are most likely other things I could have done better, but that's exactly what I'm looking forward to learning. onto the next one!
